forecast
========

A simple use of the Forecast.io API combined with an associated background image based on a predetermined geolocation.

Replace your own forecast.io API key and lat,long desired location in the API call. Also replace whatever image names and commentary you'd like to associate. There is also an ability to attribute the image used.

Future potential updates:
1) dynamic geolocation detection.
2) background image pull from an image API such as Flickr (similar to the Yahoo Weather App). I originally did this but wasn't satisfied with the randomness of the images pulled.
